\emph{Symmetry breaking} plays a key role in modern SAT-solving by substantially reducing the search space of assignments to a formula~\cite{biereHandbookSatisfiabilityVolume2009,Crawford}.
For example, if one proves that all satisfying assignments to a formula $\phi$ have either (i) $x_1 = 0, x_2 = 1$, or  (ii) $x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0$, and there is a bijection between satisfying assignments of form (i) and satisfying assignments of form (ii), then one can assume, \emph{without loss of generality}, that $x_1 = 0, x_2 = 1$, and thus add unit clauses $\ov{x_1}$ and $x_2$ to the formula $\phi$ while preserving its satisfiability.

In the context of the Empty Hexagon Number, the symmetry breaking done by Heule and Scheucher consists in assuming
that in order to search for a list of $30$ points in general position without a $6$-hole,
it suffices to can search only amongst lists of $30$ points in \emph{canonical} position.
These are defined as follows.
\begin{definition}[Canonical Position]
A list $L = (p_1,\ldots, p_{n})$ of points is said to be in canonical position if it satisfies all the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{($x$-order)} The points are sorted with respect to their $x$-coordinates, i.e., $x(p_i) < x(p_j)$ for all $1 \leq i < j \leq n$.
    \item \textbf{(General Position)} No three points are collinear, i.e., for all $1 \leq i < j < k \leq n$, we have $\sigma(p_i, p_j, p_k) \neq 0$.
    \item \textbf{(CCW-order)} All orientations $\sigma(p_1, p_i, p_j)$, with $1 < i < j \leq n$, are counterclockwise.
    \item \textbf{(Lex order)} The list of orientations \( \left(\sigma\left(p_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil -1}, p_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil},p_{\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil+1}\right), \ldots, \sigma\left(p_2, p_3, p_4\right) \right)\) is not lexicographically smaller than the list \(\left(\sigma\left(p_{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor  + 1}, p_{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor+2},p_{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor+3}\right), \ldots, \sigma\left(p_{n-2}, p_{n-1}, p_{n}\right) \right).\)
    % Given the general position condition, all orientations are in $\{-1, 1\}$, and thus the lexicographic condition is equivalent to stating that there is an index $i$ such that $\forall j < i$, $\textsf{Left}[j] = \textsf{Right}[j]$, and $\textsf{Left}[i] = -1$ but $\textsf{Right}[i] = 1$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

This symmetry breaking assumption not only reduces the search space of the SAT solver, but it is required for the correctness of the encoding,
as clauses~\labelcref{eq:insideClauses1,eq:insideClauses2,eq:holeDefClauses1,eq:signotopeClauses11,eq:signotopeClauses12} rely on points being sorted from left to right.
Before discussing the proof of correctness of symmetry breaking,
let us first focus on the last condition, expressed explicitly in clause~\labelcref{eq:revLexClauses} of the encoding.
The main idea behind this condition is that \emph{reflecting} a pointset, i.e., applying the map $(x, y) \mapsto (-x, y)$,
preserves the presence of $k$-holes, or convex $k$-gons.
This is the reason for incorporating the \emph{parity} flag in the definition of $\sigma$-equivalence.
\input{fig-sigma-equiv.tex}
As illustrated in~\Cref{fig:sigma-equiv}, there are pointsets that are only $\sigma$-equivalent to their reflections
with \lstinline|parity := true|.
We are now ready to state the main symmetry breaking theorem and sketch its proof.

%     While the first 3 conditions are now arguably standard in computational results regarding Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres type problems~\cite{scheucherTwoDisjoint5holes2020}, the last condition is a novelty introduced by Heule and Scheucher.
%     Interestingly, in the process of verifying the correctness of this symmetry-breaking assumption, we found a small error in the proof presented in~\cite{scheucherTwoDisjoint5holes2020} for the first $3$ conditions.
% The concrete theorem we prove is the following:
\input{fig-symmetry-breaking.tex}
\begin{lstlisting}
theorem symmetry_breaking : ListInGenPos l →
  ∃ w : CanonicalPoints, Nonempty (l.toFinset ≃σ w.points.toFinset)
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
The proof proceeds in 6 steps, illustrated in~\Cref{fig:symmetry-breaking}. In each of the steps, we will construct a new list of points that is $\sigma$-equivalent to the previous one, and the last one will be in canonical position.\footnote{Even though we defined $\sigma$-equivalence for sets of points, our formalization goes back and forth between sets and lists. Given that symmetry breaking distinguishes between the order of the points e.g., $x$-order, this proof proceeds over lists. All permutations of a list are immediately $\sigma$-equivalent.}
The main justification for each step is that, given that the function $\sigma$ is defined as a sign of the determinant, applying transformations that preserve (or, when \lstinline|parity := true|, uniformly reverse) the sign of the determinant will preserve (or uniformly reverse) the values of $\sigma$. In particular, given the identity $\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$, if we apply a transformation to the points that corresponds to multiplying by a matrix $B$ such that $\det(B) > 0$, then $\sign(\det(A)) = \sign(\det(AB))$, and thus orientations will be preserved.
In step 1, we transform the list of points so that no two points share the same $x$-coordinate. This can be done by applying a rotation to the list of points, which corresponds to multiplying by a rotation matrix.
Rotations always have determinant $1$. 
In step 2, we translate all points by a constant vector $t$, by multiplying by a translation matrix, so that the left most point gets position $(0, 0)$, and naturally every other point will have a positive $x$-coordinate.
Let $L_2$ be the list of points after this transformation, excluding $(0,0)$ which we will denote by $p_1$.
Then, in step 3, we  apply the projective transformation $f: (x, y) \mapsto (y/x, 1/x)$ to every point in $L_2$, showing that this preserves orientations within $L_2$.
To see that this mapping is a $\sigma$-equivalence consider that 
\[
\begin{multlined}
 \sign \det \begin{pmatrix} p_x & q_x & r_x \\ p_y & q_y & r_y \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} =  \sign \det \left( \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}  \begin{pmatrix} \nicefrac{p_y}{p_x} & \nicefrac{q_y}{q_x} & \nicefrac{r_y}{r_x} \\ \nicefrac{1}{p_x} & \nicefrac{1}{q_x} & \nicefrac{1}{r_x} \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}  \begin{pmatrix} p_x & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & q_x & 0\\ 0 & 0 & r_x \end{pmatrix} \right)\\
                        = \sign \left(1 \cdot \det  \begin{pmatrix} \nicefrac{p_y}{p_x} & \nicefrac{q_y}{q_x} & \nicefrac{r_y}{r_x} \\ \nicefrac{1}{p_x} & \nicefrac{1}{q_x} & \nicefrac{1}{r_x} \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot  p_x q_x r_x  \right) = \sign \det \begin{pmatrix} p_y/p_x & q_y/q_x & r_y/r_x \\ 1/p_x & 1/q_x & 1/r_x \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
                        %  \tag{As $p_x q_x r_x > 0$ by step 2}
\end{multlined}
\]
To preserve orientations with respect to the leftmost point $(0, 0)$, we set $f( (0, 0)) = (0, \infty)$, a special point that is treated separately as follows.
As the function $\sigma$ takes points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ as arguments,
we need to define an extension
\(
  \sigma_{(0, \infty)}(q, r) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } q_x < r_x \\
    -1 & \text{otherwise}.  
  \end{cases},
\)
We then show that $\sigma((0, 0), q, r) = \sigma_{(0, \infty)}(f(q), f(r))$ for all points $q, r \in L_2$. 
In step 4, we sort the list $L_2$ by $x$-coordinate in increasing order, thus obtaining a list $L_3$.
This can be done while preserving $\sigma$-equivalence because sorting corresponds to a permutation, and all permutations of a list are $\sigma$-equivalent by definition.
In step 5, we check whether the \textsf{Lex order} condition above is satisfied in $L_3$, and if it is not, we reflect the pointset, which as explained above, preserves $\sigma$-equivalence by leveraging the parity option in the definition. Note that in such a case we need to relabel the points from left to right again.
In step 6, we bring point $(0, \infty)$ back into the range by first finding a constant $c$ such that all points in $L_3$ are to the right of the line $y=c$, and then finding a large enough value $M$ such that $(c, M)$ has the same orientation with respect to the other points as $(0, \infty)$ did, meaning that 
\(\sigma((c, M), q, r) = \sigma_{(0, \infty)}(q, r)\) for every $q, r \in L_3$.
Finally, we note that the list of points obtained in step 6 satisfies the \text{CCW-order} property by the following reasoning:
if $1 < i < j \leq n$ are indices, then 
\begin{align*}
  \sigma(p_1, p_i, p_j) = 1 &\iff \sigma((c, M), p_i, p_j) = 1\\
                            &\iff \sigma_{(0, \infty)}(p_i, p_j) = 1\tag{By step 6}\\
                            &\iff (p_i)_x < (p_j)_x \tag{By definition of $\sigma_{(0, \infty)}$}\\
                            &\iff \textsf{true} \tag{By step 4, since points are sorted and $i < j$}.
\end{align*}
This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}
