Our formalization is closely related to a prior development
in which Marić put proofs of $g(6) \leq 17$ on a more solid foundation~\cite{19maric_fast_formal_proof_erdos_szekeres_conjecture_convex_polygons_most_six_points}.
The inequality,
originally obtained by Szekeres and Peters \cite{06szekeres_computer_solution_17_point_erdos_szekeres_problem}
using a specialized, unverified search algorithm,
was confirmed by Marić using a formally-verified SAT encoding.
Marić introduced an optimized encoding based on nested convex hull structures,
which, when combined with performance advances in modern SAT solvers,
significantly improved the search time over the unverified computation.

Our work focuses on the closely-related problem
of determining $k$-hole numbers $h(k)$.
Rather than devise a new SAT encoding,
we use essentially the same encoding presented by Heule and Scheucher~\cite{emptyHexagonNumber}.
Interestingly,
a (verified) proof of $g(6) \leq 17$ can be obtained
as a corollary of our development.
We can assert the hole variables $\hvar_{a,b,c}$ as true
while leaving the remainder of the encoding in~\Cref{fig:full-encoding} unchanged,
which trivializes constraints about emptiness
so that only the convexity constraints remain.\footnote{
This modification was performed by an author
who did not understand this part of the proof,
nevertheless having full confidence in its correctness
thanks to the Lean kernel having checked every assertion.}
The resulting CNF formula
asserts the existence of a set of $n$ points
with no convex $6$-gon.
We checked this formula to be unsatisfiable for $n = 17$,
giving the same result as Marić:
\begin{lstlisting}
theorem gon_6_theorem (pts : List Point) (gp : ListInGenPos pts)
    (h : pts.length ≥ 17) : HasConvexKGon 6 pts.toFinset
\end{lstlisting}

Since both formalizations can be executed,
we performed a direct comparison against Marić's encoding.
On a personal laptop,
we found that it takes negligible time (below 1s)
for our verified Lean encoder to output the full CNF.
In contrast,
Marić's encoder, extracted from Isabelle/HOL code,\footnote{
  We used Isabelle/HOL 2016.
  Porting the encoder to more recent versions of the prover
  would require broader adaptations
  due to breaking changes in the HOL theories.}
took 437s to output a CNF.
To improve encoding performance,
Marić wrote a C++ encoder
whose code was manually compared against the Isabelle/HOL specification.
We do not need to resort to an unverified implementation.

As for the encodings,
ours took 28s to solve,
while the Marić encoding took 787s (both using \textsf{cadical}).
This difference is likely accounted for by the relative size of the encodings,
in particular their symmetry breaking strategies.
For $k=6$ and $n$ points,
the encoding of Heule and Scheucher uses $O(n^4)$ clauses,
whereas the one of Marić uses $O(n^6)$ clauses.
They are based on different ideas:
the former as detailed in~\Cref{sec:symmetry-breaking},
whereas the latter on nested convex hulls.
The different approaches have been discussed by Scheucher \cite{scheucherTwoDisjoint5holes2020}.
This progress in solve times
represents an encouraging state of affairs;
we are optimistic that if continued,
it could lead to an eventual resolution of $g(7)$.

Further differences include what exactly was formally proven.
As with most work in this area,
we use the combinatorial abstraction of triple orientations.
We and Marić alike show that point sets in $\mathbb R^2$
satisfy orientation properties (\Cref{sec:triple-orientations}).
However, our work goes further in building the connection
between geometry and combinatorics:
our definitions of convexity and emptiness (\Cref{sec:geometry}),
and consequently the theorem statements,
are geometric ones based on convex hulls
as defined in Lean's \texttt{mathlib}~\cite{The_mathlib_Community_2020}.
In contrast, Marić axiomatizes these properties in terms of $\sigma$.
A skeptical reviewer must manually verify that these combinatorial definitions
correspond to the desired geometric concept.

A final point of difference concerns the verification of SAT proofs.
Marić fully reconstructs some of the SAT proofs on which his results depend,
though not the main one for $g(6)$,
in an NbE-based proof checker for Isabelle/HOL.
We make no such attempt for the time being,
instead passing our SAT proofs through the
formally verified proof checker \texttt{cake\_lpr}~\cite{tanVerifiedPropagationRedundancy2023}
and asserting unsatisfiability of the CNF as an axiom in Lean.
Thus we trust that the CNF formula produced by the verified Lean encoder
is the same one whose unsatisfiability was checked by \textsf{cake\_lpr}.
