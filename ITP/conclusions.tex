\begin{itemize}
    \item We found some bugs 
    \item Similar theorems can be proven using our framework
    \item The main challenge to the ITP community is to better integrate SAT-solving so that end-to-end proofs are possible, instead of relying on an UNSAT axiom that is verified externally.
\end{itemize}

Compared to the work of Heule and Scheucher which we have verified \cite{emptyHexagonNumber},
besides the significant improvement in trust,
we have streamlined the symmetry breaking argument somewhat.
It no longer requires applying continuity of the determinant map,
or shearing points to have positive $y$ coordinates.
